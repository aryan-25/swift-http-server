/// A middleware implementation that links two middleware chains together.
///
/// ``ChainedMiddleware`` is responsible for properly composing two middleware chains
/// so that the output from the first middleware becomes the input to the second.
/// This allows for building complex processing pipelines through composition.
///
/// This type is primarily used internally by the ``MiddlewareChainBuilder`` to combine
/// middleware components in a type-safe way.
struct ChainedMiddleware<Input: ~Copyable, MiddleInput: ~Copyable, NextInput: ~Copyable>: Middleware {
    /// The first middleware in the chain.
    private let first: MiddlewareChain<Input, MiddleInput>

    /// The second middleware in the chain, which receives output from the first middleware.
    private let second: MiddlewareChain<MiddleInput, NextInput>

    init(
        first: MiddlewareChain<Input, MiddleInput>,
        second: MiddlewareChain<MiddleInput, NextInput>
    ) {
        self.first = first
        self.second = second
    }

    /// Processes input through both middlewares in sequence.
    ///
    /// This method implements the core chaining behavior by passing the input through
    /// the first middleware, then using the output of that operation as the input to
    /// the second middleware.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - input: The initial input value to pass to the first middleware.
    ///   - next: The next handler function to call after both middlewares have processed the input.
    ///
    /// - Throws: Any error that occurs during processing in either middleware.
